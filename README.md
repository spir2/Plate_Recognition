# Plate Recognition

## Introduction
`Plate Recognition` is an AI-powered tool designed to recognize license plates. Developed as part of a school project, this tool aims to facilitate automated gate opening by identifying license plates from a database.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to create a reliable and efficient license plate detection system that can be deployed on a Raspberry Pi environment. By integrating this system with a gate mechanism, it will enable automated access control based on vehicle identification.

## Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi (any model capable of running the necessary software and connecting to a camera)
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module

## Software Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV Library
- EasyOCR Library
- Additional Python dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
Instructions on setting up the Raspberry Pi, installing the necessary software, and running the program.

```bash
# Sample installation steps
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
pip install easyocr
# etc.
